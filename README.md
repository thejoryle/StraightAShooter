Welcome to my repo for my game entitled "Straight A Shooter!"

In Straight A Shooter, you play as a college student with their final exam just around the corner. Study and complete assignments to prepare for your final to achieve a high grade in the end. (I know what you're thinking, and there are no guns or humans in this game other than the player).

This game is a top-down shooter featuring:
* a procedurally generated map 
* various enemy types 
* different unlockable abilities 
* rpg-like progression
* a final boss which can be fought at any time throughout your playthroughs

The scoring system encourages you to experiment with different strategies to optimize your score. Because the scoring is time(and performance)-based, you constantly have to make the decision between further progression and cutting your time down for a better score.


This game was developed by a team of 4--@SebastianMarino28, @jogara2001, @BBiv, and I @thejoryle, for a university game design class. It was developed iteratively in about 5 weeks in an agile environment.

If you're interesting in playing this game, we have a web build live which can be found at: TBD
